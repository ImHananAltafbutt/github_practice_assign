 I'm Hanan Altaf, and I'm currently diving deep into the world of technology as a BS IT student. It's an exciting journey, constantly learning and exploring how software and systems shape our world. I'm really passionate about understanding the ins and outs of IT and figuring out how I can contribute to this ever-evolving field.
